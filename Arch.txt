Why the collision of the encrypted URL should be handled in the PostgreSQL?

Go code can run in multiple goroutines.

Business logic may try to avoid collisions,
but the database must be the final authority.

Business logic is where we have the Go logic, where the backend logic exists
but for the final call for collision must be the database system 


That is why when specifing the schema, we write-

UNIQUE (short_code)
